# Win Mouse Native

Provide deterministic mouse control on **Windows**.

## Commands (local)

This ClawHub bundle is **docs + scripts-as-text** (ClawHub validates “text files only”).

To install:
1) Save `win-mouse.cmd.txt` as `win-mouse.cmd`
2) Save `scripts/win-mouse.ps1.txt` as `scripts/win-mouse.ps1`

Then run:
- `win-mouse move <dx> <dy>` (relative)
- `win-mouse abs <x> <y>` (absolute screen coords)
- `win-mouse click left|right|middle`
- `win-mouse down left|right|middle`
- `win-mouse up left|right|middle`

Return value: prints a one-line JSON object.

## OpenClaw usage

When the user asks to move/click the mouse:

1) If the user didn’t give coordinates/deltas, ask.
2) Use `exec` to run `win-mouse ...`.
3) Prefer small, reversible actions first (tiny move, single click) when unsure.

## Notes

- Windows only.
- Uses Win32 `SetCursorPos` + `SendInput` via user32.dll.
